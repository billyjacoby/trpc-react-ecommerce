# tRPC React e-commerce Starter

This is a basic starter for building an e-commerce site using tRPC and ReactJS.

## Development Instructions

This project assumes that you have a postgres database running and reachable by the server code via prisma.

Reference the provided `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env` files in order to get this up and running.

Once the database is running the `yarn start` command in the root of the project will start both the server and client.
